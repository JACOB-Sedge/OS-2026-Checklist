# OS-2026-Checklist

# Activity A

## What you must include 
1. The business context
2. The functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
3. Decomposition of the problems that will need to be solved to implement the functional and non-functional requirements
4. the KPIs and user Acceptance criteria for the propsed solution
5. A description of the Proposed Solution 
6. A justification of
   * How the recommended solution meets the needs of the client and the users
   * How potential risks will be mitigated
   * How relevant regulatory guidlines and legal requiremnts, in relation to software development and the sector will be addressed

### Research Throuhout and Add to appendix 
### Include Table of Contents 

* Start with a client brief (outlines what the client wants from a project goals, requirements, expectations)
* Project constraints (constraint, scope detail)
* Inclusivity and Accessability
* Technology stack (what will we use python C# HTTPs etc)
* Identify stakeholder (internal + external)
* Stakeholder map

* Create User Personas (Name, Age, Role, Challenges, Thoughts, Goals, Expectations)
* SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and Threats)
* Key Features and Functionality (3 of each e.g User login, booking calender. admin dashboard and maintainance, performance, security)
* Risk Mitigation

### Justification
* Meeting Client and User needs
* Scalability and Future Improvements
* Legal and Regulatory Compliance
# Activity B

## What You must include
1. Visual Interface Design (High fidelity Wireframes with Annotations) 
2. Data Requirements (Alpha Testing - we will allow internal developers to test before release  Beta Testing - We will allow limited release to real users for feedback )
3. Algorithm Designs
4. Test Strategy
5. Clear Communication in Design Documentation
6. Relavant Diagrams and why they are needed
7. Appendices

## The Design
* Include user interface for each design
* Add user Journeys
* Annotate Accessability Features
* Use consistent colour scheme and fonts (use coolors.io)
* white space
* Key info in BIG text
* common conventions
* EXPLAIN REASONING THROUGHOUT
* <img width="716" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7944548a-7411-4d80-8878-a47181d1a8f3" />


## Data Requirements 

* Use Case Diagrams

### Data Flow Diagrams 
* Level 0
* <img width="469" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0555e556-6cd8-4927-93fc-a8274aee1051" />


* Level 1

### COMMUNICATE LOGIC THROUGHOUT

## Alogorithms 
* 5 complex Algorithms
* Flowchart for non-Technical users
* Pseudocode for technical users
* Precise Logic
* Clearly defined
* KEEP SIMPLE
* COMMUNICATE LOGIC THROUGHOUT

## Test Strategy 
* Top Band = Thorough and detailed
* Types of Testing
* Order of Testing
* Dependencies = external services your component relies on during testing 
* Prerequsites = conditions that must be met before we can start testing
* Test each page in your system
