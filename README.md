# OS-2026-Checklist

# Activity A

## What you must include 
1. The business context
2. The functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
3. Decomposition of the problems that will need to be solved to implement the functional and non-functional requirements
4. the KPIs and user Acceptance criteria for the propsed solution
5. A description of the Proposed Solution 
6. A justification of
   * How the recommended solution meets the needs of the client and the users
   * How potential risks will be mitigated
   * How relevant regulatory guidlines and legal requiremnts, in relation to software development and the sector will be addressed

### Research Throuhout and Add to appendix 
### Include Table of Contents 

* Start with a client brief (outlines what the client wants from a project goals, requirements, expectations)
* Project constraints (constraint, scope detail)
* Inclusivity and Accessability
* Technology stack (what will we use python C# HTTPs etc)
* Identify stakeholder (internal + external)
* Stakeholder map (High/ Low Impact/ Influence )
* Empathy Mapping  (Says, Thinks, Does, Feels)
* Create User Personas (Name, Age, Role, Challenges, Thoughts, Goals, Expectations)
* SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and Threats)
* Functional and Non-Functional Requiremnets(3 of each e.g User login, booking calender. admin dashboard and maintainance, performance, security)
* Risk Mitigation (Risk, Impact Level, Likelihood, Mitigation, Contingency )

### Justification
* Meeting Client and User needs
* Scalability and Future Improvements
* Legal and Regulatory Compliance


# Activity B

## What You must include
1. Visual Interface Design (High fidelity Wireframes with Annotations) 
2. Data Requirements (Alpha Testing - we will allow internal developers to test before release  Beta Testing - We will allow limited release to real users for feedback )
3. Algorithm Designs
4. Test Strategy
5. Clear Communication in Design Documentation
6. Relavant Diagrams and why they are needed
7. Appendices

## The Design
* Include user interface for each design
* Add user Journeys (use user personas from previous task)  (STEP/ ACTION/ TOUCHPOINT/ THOUGHT/FEELINGS/ PAIN POINTS/ OPPORTUNITIES)
* Annotate Accessability Features
* Complete accessability checklist (FEATURE/ HOW IT SUPPORTS/ IMPLEMENTS/ IMPACT IF NOT INCLUDED)
* Use consistent colour scheme and fonts (use coolors.io)
* Annotate them with their #  number (found on coolors.io and arrays same as # just ["etc", "etc"])
* WCAG compliance use https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
* white space
* Key info in BIG text
* common conventions
* EXPLAIN REASONING THROUGHOUT
* Keep Clean and Consise


## Data Requirements 

* Use Case Diagrams

* Enrtity Relationship Diagrams

* Data Dictionaries (Table Name, Field Name, Field Definition, Data Type & Length, Format/Validation Rules, Example)


* Class Diagrams (Name, Attributes, Methods)


### Data Flow Diagrams 
* Level 0
Basic Low Level One Process 


* Level 1
  Multiple Processes in depth, use for technical users


### COMMUNICATE LOGIC THROUGHOUT

## Alogorithms 
*No more than 5 complex Algorithms
* Flowchart for non-Technical users
* Pseudocode for technical users
* Precise Logic
* Clearly defined
* KEEP SIMPLE
* COMMUNICATE LOGIC THROUGHOUT
* If Flowchart is in depth no need for pseudocode

## Test Strategy 
* Top Band = Thorough and detailed
* Types of Testing
* Order of Testing
* Dependencies = external services your component relies on during testing 
* Prerequsites = conditions that must be met before we can start testing
* Test each page in your system
* Test Table (Test Date, Test Type, Prerequisites/Dependencies)
* Types of Testing (Research on google)
* Security, Usuability, Beta, Alpha, Functionality

# Coding
* Use HTML + Python + Flask
* Flak must be downloaded via Command Line
* from flask import Flask, jsonify, render_template
  import requests  

  app = Flask(__name__)

## API for json
    url = "url"
    response = requests.get(url)  
    return jsonify(response.json())

## File Structure 
* Must be organised Cleanly
* Name --> Static-->(CSS + JS files )
* Name --> templates -->(HTML files)
* name of solution should be app.py (Store this and database in Name)

# Activity 3a 
* Describe the aim of the feedback (Why + What)
* Targeted Users and Why (Technical + Non-Technical)
* What Feedback methods (Surveys(Google Forms) + Interviews) Could use OBS
* Must put Survey and interview questions into forms
* Once data is gathered Make Graphs highest rated + Lowest Rated

# Activity 3b
* Evaulate feedback (What went well + what didn't)
* If feature didn't work as intended say
* Discuss what went well and bad
* Say any legal and ethical considerations

## Evaluate against the requiremments 
* Functional + Non-Functional Requirements (Did you meet them)
* KPSIs
* User Acceptance Criteria
* Accessibility
